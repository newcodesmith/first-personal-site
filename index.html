            <h3>GOAL SETTING</h3>
            <p>It is important to set proper goals to help me focus and organize my time and resources so that I can be more
                affective in my life. I try to do this on a daily basis. Here are a few examples of goals I have set and
                accomplished.

                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #1 - Start Learning JavaScript via Codecademy.
                        <br>A. This goal was met and will be continued to be worked on.
                        <br>B. I want to start this in the afternoon after lunch for a couple of hours.
                        <br>C. This should be easy to accomplish.
                        <br>D. It is realistic as this time is mine to use as study time.
                        <br>E. In order for me to complete the JS portion of my school work I will need to learn this material.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was met and will continue to be worked on.
                        <br>B. Doing the tutorials went well as I stayed focused and decided thaqt I would not get frustrated
                        as I have in the past. I feel like I am getting a better understanding of JS basics after working
                        on this. I was also able to get through a few more sections than I thought I would because of my
                        mindset.
                        <br>C. When I first started I did set the stage but there was a lot of talking around me in the classroom
                        so I had to put on headphones so that I could concentrate on what I was reading and doing.
                        <br>D. I may start with headphones on but I don’t feel like I should change up what I am doing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #2 - Look for and set up branding for myself. (Matching domain name, GitHub, LinkedIn)
                        <br>A. I want to do this in the evening.
                        <br>B. This can take some time finding a name that has not been taken for all of these sites.
                        <br>C. This might take longer than one evening. I might need to set some additional time aside.
                        <br>D. This will help me set a foundation for marketing and branding myself when I am ready to start
                        searching for a job.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was completed
                        <br>B. I first tried to think of any unique names using some form of my name. I search godaddy.com to
                        see if any of my ideas were being used and many were. Once I found a name that was not being used
                        as a domain I then checked to see if the name was used as usernames for the other two sites until
                        I found something. (newcodesmith.com)
                        <br>C. Unfortunately, my name is very common and was not able to find anything available for michaelsmith.com.
                        <br>D. I am not sure if I would do anything different with this goal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #3 - Find a Meet Up to attend.
                        <br>A. I want to take 15 min this evening to do this.
                        <br>B. This should be achievable to find at least one meeting.
                        <br>C. This is realistic
                        <br>D. This is something I need to get done for my Personal Web Site.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was met.
                        <br>B. I went to meetup.com and was able to find a meetup for tomorrow that I am able to attend. The
                        process did not take me long and I was able to sign up with my existing Gmail account. The goal took
                        me much less time than I thought it would as previous attempts had not be as successful.
                        <br>C. There was nothing this time around that didn’t go well. In the past it was hard to find a meetup
                        on a night that I was able to go.
                        <br>D. I will continue to look for meetups and reach out to other people for suggestions for meet ups.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #1 - Setup a time for every day to make goals
                        <br>A. This will be done before the end of today.
                        <br>B. This should be easy to take 5 min every morning to do this.
                        <br>C. This should be a realistic.
                        <br>D. Setting goals every day can help me be more productive.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was completed.
                        <br>B. I have decided to do this in the evening the day before as my schedule is very busy in the morning.
                        I will be starting this as my first “to do” after I put my kids down and then review the goals first
                        thing in the morning.
                        <br>C. There wasn’t anything that didn’t go well.
                        <br>D. I need to ensure I stay consistent with doing goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #2 - Attend Meetup
                        <br>A. Meetup for Progressive Apps at 6pm today.
                        <br>B. All I need to do is show up.
                        <br>C. This is realistic as long as nothing happens to me or my car or the meeting getting cancelled.
                        <br>D. This is something that needs to be done right away.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. I completed this goal.
                        <br>B. I was able to attend the meet up and was able to go with a couple of classmates. I was able to
                        make a few connections at the meetup and enjoyed the topic.
                        <br>C. Unfortunately, I was not able to stay the entire time to do the workshop due to the time and weather.
                        <br>D. I am not sure If I will do anything different.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #3 -Complete One Learn to Learn assessment.
                        <br>A. This needs to be done before the end of the day.
                        <br>B. I have todays class time to start this.
                        <br>C. This is realistic as I am learning something new every day.
                        <br>D. This is something that needs to be done right away.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This was completed
                        <br>B. I had set out to learn how to make a triangle. It did not take me long to find the answer via
                        google search and the code was very strait forward.
                        <br>C. I have already submitted the assignment and did pass but, learned that I need to be a little clearer.
                        <br>D. I will change the format a little to ensure that what I am learning is clearer.
                    </p>
                    <p id="goal_3" class="_hidden">12-11-17
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #1 – Use class time to continue JS learning. At least one hour a day.
                        <br>A. This will be done over the next couple of days.
                        <br>B. This should be easy to study for at least an hour.
                        <br>C. This is realistic as they give us time in class to work on this.
                        <br>D. I need to learn JS to work on the next couple of assignments.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was met today.
                        <br>B. I used the JavaScript for Kids book to study. After reading through some of the chapters I had
                        already read through in the past, things are starting to click a little more. I also was able to
                        go through the Loops section on Codecademy.
                        <br>C. By the time I got to the Codecademy I was getting sleepy and needed to get some coffee. Some of
                        my other classmates were a little distracting so I had to get up and go to another location.
                        <br>D. Tomorrow I show that there are a few break outs that I will be attending.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #2 – Find Another Meetup to Attend
                        <br>A. This needs to be done before the end of the day.
                        <br>B. I have todays class time to start this and can finish this evening if I run out of time.
                        <br>C. This is realistic.
                        <br>D. This is important to continue to network and learn about the industry I want to work in.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was met.
                        <br>B. I did a search on Meetup.com and was able to find a meetup to attend on Wednesday for UX design.
                        I did find a few others but they were on days I was not able to attend.
                        <br>C. The only thing that was a challenge was my availability.
                        <br>D. I don’t think I will do anything different other than asking others what Meet Up’s that will be
                        attending.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>Goal #3 - Complete One Learn to Learn assessment.
                        <br>A. This needs to be done before the end of the day.
                        <br>B. I have todays class time to start this.
                        <br>C. This is realistic as I am learning something new every day.
                        <br>D. This is something that needs to be done right away.

                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>A. This goal was not met.
                        <br>B. I was able to do some studying and was able to learn some things but I did not set out to learn
                        something specific and did not write up a Learn to Learn. Part of this had to do with my lack of
                        energy and sleep.
                        <br>C. I will find something specific I need to go over and set the time aside.

            <h3>LEARN TO LEARN</h3>
            <p>Learn to Learn is a process consisting of three parts to increase the effectiveness at which one learns. These
                three parts are as follows.
                <br>- Clearing the stage
                <br>- Clarifying the what and the why of what you want to learn
                <br>- Prioritize process over product.
                <br>Below you will find some examples of this process.

                        <br>- Got a glass of water.
                        <br>- Moved to quite room.
                        <br>- Cleared other open windows on computer.

                        <br>- Today in class we were asked to recreate a poster using HTML and CSS. There were shapes in the
                        poster that I did not have experience with making and was clearing going to need to figure out how
                        to make these shapes. I decided to use my good old friend google to look for the answer. I did see
                        a few options in my search and decided on one to make a triangle for the poster using CSS. The process
                        was much simpler than I thought it would be. When I started with the stock settings I realized that
                        I was going to need to make some adjustments. Once messing with the settings, a little bit, I could
                        see how the settings affected the shape and was able to quickly size it to my specific specifications.
                        <br>
                        <br>Reflection
                        <br>- I was able to complete the task and it helped having my area clean and clear and my coffee so I
                        did not get sleepy. When switching between windows I did not get distracted by other apps running
                        making the switch more efficient. I hope to check out more of the example shapes in the article that
                        I found and apply them to other future projects.

                        <br> What do I want to learn?
                        <br> - I want to learn how to implement the Parallax Scrolling effect.

                        <br> Setting the stage.

                        <br> Play
                        <br> - I went in to learning about Parallax Scrolling as something that may be complicated or hard. I
                        started by a google search and did not have any issues finding documentation. I used w3school.com
                        to learn how to accomplish this and have found this site very helpful with learning many technics.
                        The code was very strati forward. All I needed to do was set the background image as fixed with a
                        few other parameters and allow everything else to scroll on the page. I was able to setup some HTML
                        and a couple of pictures and replicate the effect successfully.

                        <br> - I found that my preparation helped and limited the time away from learning. I am looking forward
                        to using this on my own personal site. I also want to learn how to use moving pictures or gif’s on
                        my site as backgrounds.

                        <br> - Got a cup of coffee.
                        <br> - Moved to quite area on the couch.

                        <br> Play
                        <br> - I set out to learn For Loops so I could complete one of my drills for class. I had been struggling
                        with this drill or a few days. I started with reviewing some documentation about Loops, Arrays, and
                        Objects. I then watched a video on JavaScript basics that was recommended by another instructor.
                        After reading and watching the video the information was slowly starting to make sense but there
                        were still elements I was not understanding. I decided to engage one of the instructors to break
                        it down. I did not want to answer but I want to have him lead me to the answer. After a few hours
                        of this I finally was able to complete the drill and have a better understanding of loops.

                        <br> - Setting the stage help as it reduced the amount of interruptions I had so I could focus on the
                        material. Siting on the couch made me comfortable while watching the almost hour-long video. I am
                        looking forward to applying what I learned in the future.

                        <br>A 1-2 paragraph description of what you learned at the meetup
                        <br> - The meetup was hosted by Kenzan which is a software engineering/professional services company
                        that provides customized end-to-end solutions. The discussion focused on Progressive Web Apps. The
                        average phone user only uses abut 3 of the apps they install on their phone. Most everything else
                        is access via the browser. With Progressive Web App’s, developers are able to design a user experience
                        that feels native and runs much faster as it caches some of the information on the device after the
                        first use. This is valuable as most of the world only has access to 2G internet speeds. They did
                        go over some code but I could only understand a little bit of it. I do feel that Progressive Web
                        Apps are the future and I am excited to learn more about them.

                        to try and do once I learn more JavaScript. I am sure I will come up with additional questions after
                        working that.

                        <br>A 1-2 paragraph description of what you learned at the meetup
                        <br> - The meetup was hosted by Tyler Merry and Andrew Fullerton at the Irish Snug here is Denver. The
                        format was very relaxed and there was no presentation planned. I got a chance to mingle amongst other
                        UX/UI designers. I learned that UX is more of the research portion of the User Design Experience
                        and UI was the designing of the User Experience after the research is done. Don Abrams from InVisionApp
                        was showing off a new piece of software he was developing for UI design and from the feedback of
                        other designers, they did like what he was working on. I talked to some other designers about their
                        companies and backgrounds. One couple attended an online program for a few months and enjoyed their
                        experience.

                        application.

                        <br> - The Meet Up/ Event was put on by Vinyl Me, Please which is a record club based here in Denver.
                        Attendees get the opportunity to listen to the current record of the month while socializing. While
                        there I was able to meet to Co-Founder of the company and talk with him about their format and how
                        they started the company. They are also currently looking for a UX/UI designer to help them with
                        new products and their site.
                        <br>I also met a Shelby who is a Front-End Developer for a Marketing and Advertising company based out
                        of Denver. They design websites and digital marketing material for other companies. Shelby was interested
                        in me going to Galvanize and asked me to give her a call once I graduate.

                        <br> - I am meeting more people and companies that are not only interested in Front-End and back-End
                        development but also looking for UX/UI designers. I think this is an area that I would like to learn
                        more about as I think it is very important when coding and designing my own sites/apps.
